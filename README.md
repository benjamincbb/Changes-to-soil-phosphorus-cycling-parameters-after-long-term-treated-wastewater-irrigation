# Changes to soil phosphorus cycling parameters after long-term treated wastewater irrigation in agroforestry lands of a humid region


This research evaluated the effects of long-term TWW irrigation on soil phosphorus (P) dynamics, physicochemical properties, and microbial activity in agricultural and forest soils at ‘The Living Filter’ sites, within the Susquehanna River watershed in Pennsylvania, USA.

The raw data available in this repository include the following physicochemical and enzymatic measurements:

- pH
- Electrical conductivity
- Water content
- Soil organic
- Ferrous iron
- Ferric iron
- Water extractable P
- P fractionation
- P adsorption curves
- P desorption
- Microbial biomass P
- Acid phosphatase activity
- Alkaline phosphatase activity
- Phosphodiesterase activity
- Pyrophosphatase activity
