# Changes to soil phosphorus cycling parameters after long-term treated wastewater irrigation in agroforestry lands of a humid region


This research evaluated the effects of long-term TWW irrigation on soil phosphorus (P) dynamics, physicochemical properties, and microbial activity in agricultural and forest soils at ‘The Living Filter’ sites, within the Susquehanna River watershed in Pennsylvania, USA.
